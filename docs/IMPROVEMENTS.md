# Project Analysis and Improvement Suggestions

This document outlines the current features of the Jira Time Tracker application and provides suggestions for potential improvements and new features.

## 1. Time Tracking

### Current Features
- **Manual Timers:** Users can manually start, pause, resume, and stop timers for each task.

### Potential Improvements
- **Automatic Idle Detection:** Detect when the user is idle (no mouse or keyboard activity) and offer to discard the idle time, keeping time tracking accurate.
