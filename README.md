## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm package manager
- Git (for project path features)
- GitHub CLI (optional, for GitHub Actions integration)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-time-tracker.git
   cd project-time-tracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up Project data:**

   - Ensure `json/data.json` exists with your Project ticket data
   - The file should contain an array of objects with `ticket_number`, `ticket_name`, and `story_points` properties

4. **Configure environment (optional):**
   - Set up GitHub CLI authentication if using GitHub Actions integration
   - Configure any additional environment variables as needed

## Usage

### Development Mode

Start the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This launches the Electron app with hot-reloading enabled for development.

### Production Build

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The packaged application will be output to the `dist/` directory.

### Basic Usage

1. **Starting a Timer:**

   - Use the floating timer window or main dashboard
   - Select a Project ticket from the dropdown
   - Click "Start" to begin tracking time

2. **Managing Sessions:**

   - Pause/resume timers as needed
   - Mark tasks as complete when finished
   - View session history in the main dashboard

3. **System Tray Access:**

   - Right-click the system tray icon for quick actions
   - Toggle floating timer visibility
   - Access main window and settings

4. **Export Data:**
   - Use the Export button in the main dashboard
   - Choose format (CSV or JSON) and date range
   - Filter by specific projects if needed

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Toggle floating timer:** Configurable global hotkey
- **Start/pause current timer:** Available in floating window
- **Navigate between tickets:** Arrow keys in timer selection

## Data Persistence

All application data is stored locally using `electron-store`, which creates JSON files in the system's user data directory:

- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%/project-time-tracker/`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/project-time-tracker/`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/project-time-tracker/`

### Data Structure

- **Sessions:** Timer sessions with start/end times, duration, and status
- **Settings:** User preferences and theme settings
- **Project Paths:** Local directory paths for Git integration
- **Project Data:** Cached ticket information and story points

## Configuration

### Project Data Format

The `json/data.json` file should follow this structure:

```json
[
  {
    "ticket_number": "PROJ-123",
    "ticket_name": "Implement user authentication",
    "story_points": 3.0
  },
  {
    "ticket_number": "PROJ-124",
    "ticket_name": "Fix login validation bug",
    "story_points": 1.0
  }
]
```
