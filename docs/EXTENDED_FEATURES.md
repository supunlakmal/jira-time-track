# Extended Project Features and Analysis

This document provides a detailed explanation of the Jira Time Tracker application's features, expanding on the information in `IMPROVEMENTS.md` and incorporating insights from the project's codebase.

## 1. Time Tracking

### Current Features

#### Manual Timers
- **Description**: Users can initiate, pause, resume, and stop timers for individual tasks. This provides granular control over time spent on each activity.
- **Implementation Analysis**:
    - **Frontend**: The `renderer/components/timers/TimerDetail.tsx` component provides the UI for these actions (Start, Pause, Resume, Hold, Complete, Stop buttons). The `renderer/pages/float.tsx` component manages the `timers` state and the `handleTimerAction` function, which updates the local timer state and dispatches IPC events to the main process.
    - **Backend (Main Process)**: The `main/background.ts` file listens for IPC events like `start-task`, `pause-task`, `resume-task`, `stop-task` from the renderer process. These events trigger updates to the `timers` state in the floating window and potentially other background logic.
    - **Data Persistence**: The `main/dataManager.ts` class, utilizing `electron-store`, is responsible for saving and retrieving session data. The `saveSession` method in `dataManager.ts` is called when timer state changes, ensuring persistence across application restarts.
- **Benefits**: Offers flexibility for users to manage their time precisely, adapting to interruptions and changes in workflow.
- **Technical Considerations**: Ensuring accurate time tracking across different states (running, paused, held) and robust data persistence is crucial. The current implementation uses `setInterval` in the renderer, which is then persisted via IPC to the main process's `electron-store`.

#### Timer Grid
- **Description**: The main interface presents a grid-like display of all available tasks, enabling users to easily view and control timers for each task.
- **Implementation Analysis**:
    - **Frontend**: The `renderer/components/timers/TimerGrid.tsx` component renders the collection of `TimerGridItem.tsx` components. Each `TimerGridItem` represents a single task and displays its current status and elapsed time. The `renderer/pages/float.tsx` component passes the `timers` array to `TimerGrid`.
- **Benefits**: Provides a clear, at-a-glance overview of all tasks and their timer statuses, improving task management and selection.
- **Technical Considerations**: Efficient rendering of a potentially large number of timers and real-time updates without performance degradation. The current grid layout seems to handle this well.

#### Floating Window
- **Description**: A compact, always-on-top window offers quick access to active timers and essential controls, allowing users to manage time tracking without needing to keep the main application window open.
- **Implementation Analysis**:
    - **Frontend**: The `renderer/pages/float.tsx` is the core component for this window. It uses `FloatingWindowHeader.tsx` for draggable functionality and `TimerGrid.tsx` or `TimerDetail.tsx` for content.
    - **Backend (Main Process)**: The `main/background.ts` file contains the `createFloatingWindow` function, which configures the Electron `BrowserWindow` with properties like `alwaysOnTop: true`, `frame: false`, and `transparent: true`. IPC channels (`window-move`, `window-resize`, `toggle-float-window`) are used to control its behavior from the renderer and system tray.
- **Benefits**: Enhances user convenience and productivity by keeping time tracking accessible and unobtrusive.
- **Technical Considerations**: Managing window positioning, resizing, and transparency across different operating systems. IPC communication is essential for controlling this window from other parts of the application (e.g., main window, system tray).

#### Manual Task Creation
- **Description**: Users have the ability to add tasks manually that are not sourced from Jira or imported via CSV, providing flexibility for non-Jira related work.
- **Implementation Analysis**:
    - **Backend (Main Process)**: The `main/dataManager.ts` class includes methods like `addManualTask`, `getManualTasks`, `updateManualTask`, and `deleteManualTask`. These methods interact with the `electron-store` to persist manual task data separately from Jira-imported tasks.
    - **IPC**: `main/background.ts` exposes IPC handlers (`add-manual-task`, `get-manual-tasks`, etc.) to allow the renderer process to interact with manual task data.
    - **Frontend**: While not explicitly detailed in the provided `float.tsx` or timer components, it's implied that there's a UI (likely in the main application window) that calls these IPC methods to create and manage manual tasks.
- **Benefits**: Increases the versatility of the application, making it useful for a wider range of users and work types.
- **Technical Considerations**: Ensuring data consistency between manual tasks and imported tasks, especially when displaying them together (e.g., `dataManager.getAllTasks()`).

#### Session Tracking
- **Description**: All time tracking sessions, including start time, end time, and duration, are meticulously saved for each task.
- **Implementation Analysis**:
    - **Frontend**: The `TaskTimer` interface (likely defined in `renderer/types/dashboard.ts`) includes a `sessions: Session[]` array. The `float.tsx` component updates this array within its `setTimers` logic and dispatches `saveSession` to the Redux store.
    - **Redux**: The `renderer/store/sessionsSlice.ts` defines the structure for `Session` and `TimerSession` and provides reducers to manage these sessions in the Redux store.
    - **Data Persistence**: The `main/dataManager.ts` `saveSession` method takes the `TimerSession` object (which includes the `sessions` array) and persists it using `electron-store`.
- **Benefits**: Provides a detailed history of time spent on each task, enabling accurate reporting and analysis.
- **Technical Considerations**: Managing the granularity of sessions (e.g., how short a pause should be before a new session is created), handling edge cases like application crashes during an active session, and efficient storage of potentially large numbers of sessions.

### Potential Improvements (Time Tracking)

#### Automatic Idle Detection
- **Description**: The application would detect periods of user inactivity (no mouse or keyboard input) and offer options to discard the idle time, ensuring time tracking remains accurate and reflects actual work.
- **Proposed Implementation**:
    - **Main Process**: Electron's `powerMonitor` module can be used to detect system idle time. `ipcMain` would expose an API (e.g., `get-idle-time`) that the renderer can query.
    - **Renderer Process**: A `useEffect` hook in `float.tsx` or a dedicated hook (`useIdleDetection.ts`) would periodically check the idle time via IPC. If idle time exceeds a configurable threshold, a modal or notification would appear, prompting the user to take action (e.g., "You've been idle for X minutes. Discard idle time?").
    - **UI**: A new UI component (e.g., `IdleDetectionModal.tsx`) would handle the user interaction.
- **Benefits**: Improves the accuracy of time tracking, prevents inflated work hours, and encourages focused work.
- **Technical Considerations**: Cross-platform compatibility of idle detection, configurable idle thresholds, and graceful handling of user input during idle periods.

#### Pomodoro Timer
- **Description**: Integrate a Pomodoro timer to help users focus by breaking work into focused intervals (e.g., 25 minutes) separated by short breaks (e.g., 5 minutes), with longer breaks after a set number of cycles.
- **Proposed Implementation**:
    - **Main Process**: A new module in `main/modules/pomodoro/` could manage the Pomodoro state, timers, and notifications. It would use `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout` for intervals and `electron.Notification` for system notifications.
    - **IPC**: New IPC channels (e.g., `start-pomodoro`, `pause-pomodoro`, `pomodoro-tick`, `pomodoro-finished`) would allow the renderer to control and receive updates.
    - **Renderer Process**: A new UI component (e.g., `PomodoroTimer.tsx`) would display the timer and controls. It would interact with the main process via IPC.
    - **Configuration**: Add settings for work duration, short break duration, long break duration, and number of cycles in a settings page.
- **Benefits**: Enhances focus, reduces burnout, and promotes regular breaks, leading to improved productivity.
- **Technical Considerations**: Ensuring the timer runs accurately even when the app is in the background or minimized, handling system sleep, and providing clear visual and auditory cues for state changes.

#### Offline Tracking
- **Description**: Ensure that time tracking timers continue to function seamlessly even when the application loses internet connectivity, with data syncing automatically once a connection is restored.
- **Proposed Implementation**:
    - **Data Persistence**: The current use of `electron-store` in `main/dataManager.ts` already provides local persistence, which is a strong foundation for offline capabilities.
    - **Connectivity Detection**: The `main/background.ts` could use Node.js's `net` module or a simple `ping` to a reliable external server to detect online/offline status. This status can be broadcasted via IPC.
    - **Sync Logic**: When connectivity is restored, a dedicated sync mechanism (e.g., in `main/dataManager.ts` or a new `syncManager.ts`) would compare local data with any remote data (e.g., Jira worklogs, if implemented) and resolve conflicts or push local changes.
- **Benefits**: Guarantees uninterrupted time tracking, crucial for users in environments with unstable internet or those who work remotely.
- **Technical Considerations**: Conflict resolution strategies for data discrepancies between local and remote storage, handling large volumes of unsynced data, and providing clear feedback to the user about sync status.

#### Global Hotkeys
- **Description**: Allow users to configure global keyboard shortcuts to start/stop the last active timer or a specific task, even when the application is not in focus.
- **Proposed Implementation**:
    - **Main Process**: Electron's `globalShortcut` module in `main/background.ts` would be used to register and unregister global hotkeys.
    - **Configuration**: A new section in the application's settings (e.g., `renderer/pages/settings.tsx`) would allow users to define their preferred hotkeys and associate them with specific actions (e.g., "start/stop last timer", "start timer for JIRA-123").
    - **IPC**: When a global hotkey is pressed, the `globalShortcut` handler in `main/background.ts` would send an IPC message to the `float.tsx` renderer process to trigger the corresponding timer action.
- **Benefits**: Significantly improves workflow efficiency by allowing users to control timers without switching application focus.
- **Technical Considerations**: Avoiding conflicts with system-level or other application hotkeys, providing a user-friendly interface for hotkey configuration, and ensuring hotkeys work reliably across different keyboard layouts.

#### Task Grouping
- **Description**: Enable users to group tasks by project or custom categories for better organization and navigation within the timer grid.
- **Proposed Implementation**:
    - **Data Model**: Enhance the `TaskTimer` interface (and underlying data in `dataManager.ts`) to include a `projectId` or `category` field.
    - **UI**: In `renderer/components/timers/TimerGrid.tsx`, implement grouping logic. This could involve using a library for virtualized lists if the number of tasks is very large, or simply rendering sections for each group. A dropdown or filter option could allow users to select how tasks are grouped (e.g., "Group by Project", "Group by Custom Category").
    - **Filtering/Sorting**: Extend the existing filtering and sorting capabilities to include grouping options.
- **Benefits**: Enhances organization and navigability, especially for users managing a large number of tasks across various projects or categories.
- **Technical Considerations**: Performance implications of grouping and filtering large datasets, user interface for defining and managing custom categories, and ensuring consistent grouping logic across different views (e.g., dashboard).

## 2. Jira Integration

### Current Features

#### Jira Connection
- **Description**: Users can securely connect the application to their Jira instance by providing their Jira domain, email, and an API token.
- **Implementation Analysis**:
    - **Main Process**: The `main/modules/jira/secureStorage.ts` likely handles the secure storage of Jira credentials using Electron's `safeStorage` or a similar mechanism. `main/modules/jira/config.ts` might manage the configuration settings.
    - **IPC**: IPC channels would be used to send credentials from the renderer (settings page) to the main process for secure storage and validation.
    - **Jira Service**: `main/modules/jira/jiraService.ts` would contain the logic for making API calls to Jira, using the stored credentials.
- **Benefits**: Enables seamless integration with Jira, allowing users to track time against their existing Jira issues.
- **Technical Considerations**: Robust security measures for storing sensitive Jira credentials, error handling for connection failures, and clear feedback to the user about connection status.

#### Fetch Jira Issues
- **Description**: The application can retrieve Jira issues based on a specified JQL (Jira Query Language) query.
- **Implementation Analysis**:
    - **Jira Service**: `main/modules/jira/jiraService.ts` would contain the core logic for executing JQL queries against the Jira API.
    - **IPC**: An IPC handler in `main/background.ts` (e.g., `fetch-jira-issues`) would receive the JQL query from the renderer and call the `jiraService`.
    - **Frontend**: A UI component (e.g., in `renderer/pages/jira-settings.tsx` or a dedicated issue selection component) would allow users to input JQL and trigger the fetch operation.
- **Benefits**: Allows users to pull in relevant tasks from Jira, ensuring they are working on the correct issues.
- **Technical Considerations**: Handling large query results, pagination for performance, error handling for invalid JQL, and rate limiting to avoid overwhelming the Jira API.

#### Jira Issues as Tasks
- **Description**: Fetched Jira issues are automatically populated as tasks within the application, making them ready for time tracking.
- **Implementation Analysis**:
    - **Data Manager**: After fetching Jira issues, `main/dataManager.ts`'s `setProjectData` method would be used to store these issues as `projectData`.
    - **Frontend**: The `float.tsx` and other dashboard components would then display these `projectData` items alongside any manual tasks. The `TaskTimer` interface likely maps Jira issue fields (e.g., `key`, `summary`, `story points`) to its own properties (`ticketNumber`, `ticketName`, `storyPoints`).
- **Benefits**: Streamlines the workflow by eliminating manual data entry for Jira tasks, ensuring consistency between Jira and the time tracker.
- **Technical Considerations**: Mapping Jira fields to internal task structure, handling updates to Jira issues (e.g., status changes, title changes) and reflecting them in the application.

### Potential Improvements (Jira Integration)

#### Automatic Worklog Sync
- **Description**: Automatically (or with a single click) post tracked time as worklogs to the corresponding Jira issue, eliminating manual worklog entry in Jira.
- **Proposed Implementation**:
    - **Jira Service**: Extend `main/modules/jira/jiraService.ts` with a method to create/update Jira worklogs. This would involve making authenticated POST requests to the Jira Worklog API.
    - **Data Manager**: `main/dataManager.ts` would need to track which sessions have been synced to Jira. A new field (e.g., `isSyncedToJira: boolean`) could be added to the `Session` interface.
    - **IPC**: An IPC channel (e.g., `sync-worklog`) would be exposed from `main/background.ts`.
    - **UI**: A button or toggle in `TimerDetail.tsx` or a batch sync option on the dashboard would trigger the sync.
- **Benefits**: Saves significant time and reduces errors by automating the worklog submission process, ensuring Jira is always up-to-date.
- **Technical Considerations**: Handling network errors during sync, conflict resolution if worklogs are modified in Jira externally, and providing clear feedback on sync success/failure.

#### Create/Edit Jira Issues
- **Description**: Allow users to create new Jira issues or edit existing ones directly from within the application, reducing the need to switch to the Jira web interface.
- **Proposed Implementation**:
    - **Jira Service**: Add methods to `main/modules/jira/jiraService.ts` for creating and updating Jira issues via the Jira API. This would involve understanding Jira's issue creation/update API endpoints and required fields.
    - **IPC**: Expose new IPC handlers (e.g., `create-jira-issue`, `edit-jira-issue`) in `main/background.ts`.
    - **UI**: New forms or dialogs in the renderer (e.g., `CreateIssueDialog.tsx`, `EditIssueDialog.tsx`) would collect user input and send it to the main process via IPC.
- **Benefits**: Improves user experience and efficiency by centralizing Jira-related actions within the time tracker.
- **Technical Considerations**: Handling various Jira field types (text, dropdowns, users, dates), validating input against Jira's requirements, and providing a user-friendly interface for complex issue structures.

#### Real-time Sync
- **Description**: Implement real-time synchronization to reflect changes in Jira issues (e.g., status changes, new comments, assignee changes) within the application.
- **Proposed Implementation**:
    - **Jira Webhooks/Polling**:
        - **Webhooks (Preferred)**: If the Jira instance allows, configure webhooks in Jira to send notifications to a local server (running in the main Electron process) whenever an issue changes. This would require setting up a small HTTP server within the Electron app.
        - **Polling (Fallback)**: Periodically poll the Jira API for updates to tracked issues. This is less efficient but more universally applicable.
    - **IPC**: When changes are detected, the main process would send IPC messages to the renderer to update the relevant `TaskTimer` objects.
- **Benefits**: Keeps the application's view of Jira issues consistently up-to-date, reducing discrepancies and improving decision-making.
- **Technical Considerations**: Setting up and securing a local webhook endpoint, managing polling intervals to avoid API rate limits, and efficiently updating the UI with incoming changes.

#### Advanced JQL Support
- **Description**: Provide a more user-friendly interface for building complex JQL queries instead of requiring users to write them manually.
- **Proposed Implementation**:
    - **UI Component**: A new UI component (e.g., `JQLBuilder.tsx`) could offer a visual query builder with dropdowns for fields, operators, and values. It could also include an autocomplete feature for Jira fields and values.
    - **Jira API**: Utilize Jira's API for metadata (e.g., available fields, project names, issue types) to populate the query builder.
    - **Query Translation**: The UI component would translate the visual selections into a valid JQL string before sending it to the `jiraService`.
- **Benefits**: Makes the powerful JQL feature accessible to a wider range of users, improving their ability to filter and select tasks.
- **Technical Considerations**: Parsing and validating user input for JQL, handling complex nested queries, and providing helpful error messages for invalid queries.

#### Support for Multiple Jira Accounts
- **Description**: Allow users to connect and switch between multiple Jira instances or accounts within the application.
- **Proposed Implementation**:
    - **Data Model**: Modify `main/modules/jira/secureStorage.ts` and `main/dataManager.ts` to store credentials and associated data for multiple Jira accounts. Each `TaskTimer` would need to be associated with a specific Jira account ID.
    - **UI**: A new account management section in settings would allow users to add, edit, and remove Jira accounts. A dropdown or selector in the main UI would enable switching between active accounts.
    - **Jira Service**: `main/modules/jira/jiraService.ts` would need to be refactored to operate with a specific Jira account's credentials for each API call.
- **Benefits**: Caters to users who work with multiple Jira instances (e.g., consultants, users with separate work/personal Jira accounts), enhancing flexibility.
- **Technical Considerations**: Securely managing multiple sets of credentials, ensuring data isolation between accounts, and providing a clear user experience for switching contexts.
