Project Time Tracker is a cross-platform desktop application built with Nextron (Next.js + Electron) that helps developers track time spent on Project tickets. It features both a main
dashboard and a floating timer window, CSV data import, productivity tools like idle detection, time goals, and comprehensive reporting with data export
capabilities. The app uses Redux for state management and electron-store for local data persistence.
