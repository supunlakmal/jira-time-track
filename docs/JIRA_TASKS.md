# Proposed Jira Tasks for Project Improvements

This document outlines potential Jira tasks derived from the `PROJECT_IMPROVEMENT_IDEAS.md` file, focusing on architectural, technical, and development workflow enhancements.

## 1. Dependency Management & Modernization

### Task: Update Core Project Dependencies
- **Story**: As a developer, I want to update the project's core dependencies (Electron, Next.js, Material UI, Redux Toolkit, TypeScript, Vitest) to their latest stable versions, so that the application benefits from improved performance, new features, enhanced security, and a better developer experience.
- **Technical Notes**: Plan a phased upgrade strategy, starting with minor versions and then tackling major versions. Ensure thorough unit, integration, and E2E testing after each major upgrade.

### Task: Conduct Comprehensive Dependency Audit
- **Story**: As a developer, I want to review all project dependencies and remove any unused or redundant libraries, so that the application's bundle size is reduced, build times are faster, and the overall attack surface is minimized.
- **Technical Notes**: Identify unnecessary packages by analyzing usage and build outputs. Remove them from `package.json` and clean up associated code.

## 2. Code Architecture & Modularity

### Task: Refactor IPC Layer into Feature Modules
- **Story**: As a developer, I want to abstract the large `main/background.ts` IPC handlers into smaller, feature-specific modules, so that the code organization is improved, IPC logic is easier to test, and separation of concerns is clearer.
- **Technical Notes**: Create new directories like `main/ipc/timeTracking.ts`, `main/ipc/jira.ts`, `main/ipc/dataManagement.ts`, and move relevant IPC handlers into them. Update `background.ts` to import and register these modules.

### Task: Create Shared Utilities and Types Directory
- **Story**: As a developer, I want to establish a `shared/` directory for common utility functions, constants, and interfaces, so that code duplication is reduced, consistency is ensured across `main` and `renderer` processes, and overall maintainability is improved.
- **Technical Notes**: Identify common helpers (e.g., time formatting, data transformations) and interfaces, and relocate them to `shared/utils` or `shared/types`.

### Task: Centralize Business Logic in Service Layer
- **Story**: As a developer, I want to centralize complex business logic into dedicated service classes or modules, so that the codebase is more testable, responsibilities are clearer, and features are easier to scale and modify.
- **Technical Notes**: Ensure `main/dataManager.ts` and `main/modules/jira/jiraService.ts` fully encapsulate their respective logic, minimizing direct manipulation from IPC handlers.

## 3. Performance & Scalability

### Task: Optimize Renderer Process with UI Virtualization
- **Story**: As a user, I want the application to remain smooth and responsive even when displaying large lists or tables, so that my experience is not degraded by performance issues.
- **Technical Notes**: Implement UI virtualization (e.g., using `react-window` or `react-virtualized`) for components like `TimerGrid` and `DataTable` that may render many items.

### Task: Investigate Main Process Threading for Heavy Computations
- **Story**: As a user, I want the application's UI to remain responsive and not freeze during heavy background computations, so that my workflow is uninterrupted.
- **Technical Notes**: Investigate offloading CPU-intensive tasks (e.g., complex analytics data processing, large file operations) to Node.js worker threads or separate Electron `BrowserWindow` instances.

### Task: Reduce Renderer Bundle Size
- **Story**: As a user, I want the application to start up quickly and consume less memory, so that my overall experience is more efficient.
- **Technical Notes**: Optimize the Next.js build for the renderer process by utilizing dynamic imports (`next/dynamic`) for code splitting, analyzing bundle composition with `webpack-bundle-analyzer`, and ensuring proper tree-shaking.

## 4. Testing & Quality Assurance

### Task: Increase Automated Test Coverage
- **Story**: As a developer, I want to ensure critical paths and new features have robust automated test coverage, so that bugs are reduced, stability is maintained during refactoring, and I receive faster feedback during development.
- **Technical Notes**: Prioritize writing unit tests for `dataManager.ts` and `jiraService.ts`, integration tests for IPC, and E2E tests with Playwright for core user flows.

### Task: Enforce Consistent Linting and Formatting
- **Story**: As a developer, I want the codebase to adhere to a consistent style, so that code readability is improved, cognitive load is reduced, and merge conflicts are minimized.
- **Technical Notes**: Configure ESLint and Prettier, and integrate them into pre-commit hooks or CI/CD pipelines for automatic formatting and style checking.

### Task: Enable Stricter TypeScript Checking
- **Story**: As a developer, I want to catch more errors at compile time and improve code reliability, so that development is more efficient and the application is more stable.
- **Technical Notes**: Review `tsconfig.json` settings and enable stricter type checking options (e.g., `strict: true`, `noImplicitAny`, `noUnusedLocals`). Address any new type errors introduced.

## 5. Developer Experience (DX)

### Task: Automate Application Release Process
- **Story**: As a developer, I want a streamlined and reliable process for building and releasing new application versions, so that manual effort is reduced and releases are more consistent.
- **Technical Notes**: Enhance existing CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automate building, testing, and packaging the Electron application for all target platforms.

### Task: Implement Enhanced Logging and Debugging
- **Story**: As a developer, I want better visibility into application behavior, especially in production, so that I can debug issues faster and proactively identify problems.
- **Technical Notes**: Implement a structured logging system (e.g., `winston` or `pino`) with detailed logs for critical operations and error handling, potentially supporting remote logging.

### Task: Create Comprehensive Developer Documentation
- **Story**: As a new developer joining the project, I want clear and comprehensive documentation, so that I can quickly onboard, understand architectural decisions, and contribute effectively without constant guidance.
- **Technical Notes**: Document architectural decisions, complex modules, setup instructions, and common development workflows in files like `CONTRIBUTING.md` or `DEVELOPMENT.md`.
